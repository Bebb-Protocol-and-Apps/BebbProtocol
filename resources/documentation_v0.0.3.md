# Bebb Protocol v0.0.3
Version 0.0.3 implements the same functionality as v0.0.2 but does so with a mono-canister architecture (versus v0.0.2's multi-canister approach resembling a microservices architecture) sacrificing an arguably superior protocol design in favor of practicality. While v0.0.2's architecture was chosen to allow the protocol to scale out automatically if needed (e.g. by spinning up new Entity or Bridge storage canisters) and aimed to improve throughput by utilizing a collection of dedicated canisters for the different functions supported, inter-canister query calls not being supported yet by the IC (and logical query calls thus having to be executed like update calls) rendered this design unusable in practice as of now as the time it takes to retrieve data from the protocol appeared too long for any meaningful user-interaction-based application. While users probably have a slightly higher tolerance in terms of responsiveness of update calls, the multi-level canister approach as developed (i.e. a create operation involves 7 canisters for Entities and up to 9 canisters for Bridges) would still be too slow for a reasonable user experience. v0.0.3 thus aims to speed up the protocol's response times significantly by circumventing any inter-canister calls and relying on a single canister to provide all functionality.
